# personal-website
Personal website I created on my own with no solution code or walkthrough from course provided.

I relied on Bootstrap for most of the design elements, but needed to modify much of it with custom CSS. Sometimes I even combined elements when I couldn't get the results I wanted from the default templates. For instance, on the Portfolio section of the Home page, I started with a Features component from Bootstrap. But, I ended up removing the icons because they didn't work well with the project images. And, I then combined the "Collapse" component so that the "Learn more" buttons would reveal project descriptions and images/videos without having to go to a separate page. The website is fully responsive.
